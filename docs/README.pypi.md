# Frenet transformation

This project implements a library to perform transformations from a 2-dimensional Cartesian to a Frenet coordinate system and vice versa.
Transformations are implemented for states up to the second time derivative.
The reference path defining the Frenet coordinate system is represented by a polychain.

## Installation

```bash
pip install frenet-state-transformation
```

## Usage

Please refer to [Github](https://github.com/phdorp/frenet-state-transformation) to view a detailed documentation and examples.
